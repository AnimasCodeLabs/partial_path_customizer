# Partial Path Customizer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AnimasCodeLabs/partial_path_customizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AnimasCodeLabs/partial_path_customizer)

Partial Path Customizer allows you to override `#to_partial_path` for a Rails model at runtime.

## Installation & Upgrading

This gem is a railtie and is meant to be used with Rails. It is tested with versions of Rails down to 3.2.

Partial Path Customizer is recommended to be run as a gem and included in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'partial_path_customizer'
```

## Helper

Partial path customizers provides a helper method to automatically set the partial path for the object
you want to render. Here is how you would render an object normally.

```erb
<%= render @bike %>
```

This would render the `bikes/bike` partial. Now if you want to customize the partial path, use the
`customize_partial_path` like this.

```erb
<%= render customize_partial_path(@bike, 'summary') %>
```

This renders the `bikes/summary` partial instead. The partial path with this helper is generated by the
object's model_name pluralized.

### Heterogenous collections

This is also very useful for rendering heterogenous collections with custom partial paths. For example, if you have
this collection:

```ruby
# Somewhere in the controller
@listings = [Bike.new, Wheelset.new, Bike.new]
```

and render it like this

```erb
<%= render @listings %>
```

it will render the partials `bikes/bike`, `wheelsets/wheels`, and `bikes/bike`. If you would like the partial names
to to be rendered like `bikes/summary`, `wheelsets/summary`, and `bikes/summary`, you can do this

```erb
<%= render customize_partial_path(@listings, 'summary') %>
```
